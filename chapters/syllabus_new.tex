\chapter*{Syllabus}
We are going to take a brief peek into the field of algebraic number theory in this ongoing seminar. Our ultimate goal is to master some basic tools and techniques, for example, the Dedekind domain and the ramification theory.

In the first part of our seminar, we will have a review on some rudiments from the ring theory and homological algebra. We shall simply follow Atiyah's \textit{An Introduction to Commutative Algebra}.

In the second part, we will briefly discuss some basic concepts in algebraic number theory, like the ring $\mathcal{O}_K$, the Dedekind domains, primary decomposition and the ramification theory.
